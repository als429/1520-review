## Data Management
* Normalization
  * Normalizing data is the process of eliminating redundant data.
  * Normalization often separates data into different tables or other logical structures; references are used to connect the data.
  * This introduces complexity in retrieval, but simplifies updates.

* Denormalization
  * Denormalized data has repeated entries.
  * Denormalization involves duplicating data in ways that make it easier to query.
  * is introduces complexity in updating, but simplifies retrieval.
 
* Key: a way of identifying data
* Primary Key: a unique identifier for a particular entry of data
* Natural Key: has meaning outside of the database - occurs naturally
* Artificial Key: has meaning only inside of the database; often generated
* Foreign Key: uses primary keys of other data to maintain referential integrity

* Indexing
  * Indexing allows us to look up data very quickly.
  * We don't index *all* the data, but some data is useful to index.
  * Different databases take different approaches, but by organizing some data into a structure that supports fast lookup and providing pointers to where the data is persisted, database access can be very fast.
 * Indexing allows databases to associate (or join) data in different places quickly.


## Templating
* Why templates?
  * Iterate over lists
  * Conditionally display content
  * Show variables
  * Create templated sites
* In Flask: `{% and %}` are used to denote logic execution
* object properties can be output to your HTML easily (`{{ user.username }}`)
* blocks allow you to set areas that will be replaced later
  * `{% block title %}` `{% endblock %}`
  * `{% for user in users %}` `{% endfor %}`
* Example: https://github.com/timothyrjames/cs1520/tree/master/week05/gae/project6


## Data transmission (AJAX + JSON) 
* XMLHttpRequest is a JS object that can be used to communicate HTTP requests and receive responses from your server
* XMLHttpRequest readystate property:
  * 0 - the request isnâ€™t yet initialized.  This is the first state for the XML HTTP object.
  * 1 - a connection to the server has been established.
  * 2 - the HTTP request was received by the server.
  * 3 - the server is processing the HTTP request.
  * 4 - the server has completed processing and has sent a response.
* AJAX Lifecycle:
  1. XMLHttpRequest Object created
  2. Open Connection `.open()`
  3. Send `.send()`
  4. `onreadystatechange` event handler called
  5. Callback Function called
* There are 2 main ways to handle errors from XMLHttpRequest:
  1. Check the "status" property for the HTTP code to make sure it's 200 / OK: `if (xmlHttp.status === 200)` 
  2. Use try-catch to handle parse errors:
```
		try {
		  let myObject = JSON.parse(xmlHttp.responseText);
		} catch (err) {
		  // handle error
		}
```
* **Creating the XMLHttpRequest Object:**
```
function createXmlHttp() {
    var xmlhttp;
    if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
        xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    } else {
        xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
    }
    if (!(xmlhttp)) {
        alert("Your browser does not support AJAX!");
    }
    return xmlhttp;
}
```
* **Sending Parameters to the Server**
```
function postParameters(xmlHttp, target, parameters) {
    if (xmlHttp) {
        xmlHttp.open("POST", target, true);
        var contentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
        xmlHttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", contentType); //setRequestHeader() allows us to identify the inclusion of parameters
        xmlHttp.send(parameters);
    }
}
```
* **Responding to a JSON Request**
```
function sendJsonRequest(targetUrl, parameters, callbackFunction) {
    var xmlHttp = createXmlHttp();
    xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (xmlHttp.readyState == 4) {
            var myObject = JSON.parse(xmlHttp.responseText);
            callbackFunction(myObject, targetUrl, parameters);
        }
    }
    postParameters(xmlHttp, targetUrl, parameters);
}
```
* We can use the JSON package in Python to easily convert primitives, lists, and dictionaries to JSON objects.
   * `import json`

## Design Patterns
* MVC

## RDBMS (Relational Databased) - ACID
* ACID
  * Atomicity
  * Consistency
  * Isolation
  * Durability
* Need strong transactional support.
* Consistent, enforced structure of data is a high priority.
* Focused in a particular region.
* Large size
* Requires SQL access.

## Non-Relational Data Storage - BASE
* BASE
  * Basically Available
  * Softstate
  * Eventual Consistency
* Example: NoSQL
* Sustained performance is more important than Atomicity, Consistency, or Isolation.
* Flexible structure of data is OK (or necessary).
* Broad distribution of the location of the data.
* **Very** large size.
* Data size requirements beyond dozens of TB

## Cloud Datastore
Entity: a thing we need to store
Namespace: allows segmentation of entities
probably won't be needed by your projects
Kind: identifies "type" of entity	
Key: identifier for the entity - can be string or int
Ancestor: an "owner" for the entity
probably won't be needed  by your projects
Descendant: entities "owned" by an ancestor

## How things operate (HTML, CSS, JS)

## Static vs. dynamic

## Events

## DOM

## Data Residency 

## Globle Scale
